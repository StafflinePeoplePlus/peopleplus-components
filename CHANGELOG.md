## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 0f82572: Add support for using drag handles on sortable grid items.

  The API is slightly different when using an explicit drag handle as previously an "item" acted as a
  drag handle, drop target, and drag image all in one. These are now exposed as separate actions -
  `handle`, `target`, and `image` respectively. The existing `item` action is still available and
  useable, but does not support being used in conjunction with any of the new actions.

  Unlike when using the existing `item` action, there are no styles applied for you when dragging.
  Instead the `data-dragging` and `data-dragging-over` attributes are set. This allows you to apply
  custom styling when an item is being dragged, or has an item dragged over it. Tailwind supports this
  nicely with the `data-[]` modifier. E.g. to emulate the previous functionality
  `data-[dragging-over]:opacity-50`

  Full Example:

  ```svelte
  <div
  	class="transition-opacity data-[dragging-over]:opacity-50 data-[dragging]:opacity-0"
  	use:sortable.target={item.id}
  	use:sortable.image={item.id}
  >
  	<div use:sortable.handle={item.id}>
  		<GripHorizontalIcon />
  	</div>
  	My Grid Item
  </div>
  ```

  As shown, the actions can be applied to the same element as needed.

### Patch Changes

- 152bfec: - Introduced `overlayClass` prop to allow custom styling on the negative space of the Drawer component.

  - The default 'Close Drawer' button has been removed.

  - If you rely on the 'Close Drawer' button, you will now need to add it manually to the slot.
  - To prevent the drawer from being dismissible by clicking outside, add `disableClickOutside` to the component props.
